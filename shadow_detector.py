        :param float threshold: The relative brightness threshold for shadow
                                detection. Defaults to 0.9, 90% of the foreground-
                                to-background brightness ratio. Range is 0.0
                                to 1.0.

                            low-pass filter. Default is 2000 for a cut-off
                            frequency of approximately 25Hz when using a
                            SAMD-51 (M4) clocked at 120MHz. Range is any positive

                            time the foreground value is read. The decay compensates
                            for slowly changing background light levels. Default is
                            0.01, equivalent to a weight of 1 foreground sample per
