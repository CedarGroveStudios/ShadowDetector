# ShadowDetector

A CircuitPython class to detect a shadow cast over an analog light sensor such as the ALS-PT19 phototransistor used in the Adafruit PyPortal, PyGamer, PyBadge, CircuitPlayground Express, CircuitPlayground Bluefruit, and the ALS-PT19 breakout board. Incorporates an optional low-pass filter to reduce sensitivity to flickering light levels greater than 25 Hz.

    Useful as a simple gesture detector.
